# DEltaNovo
De novo sequencer for stable-isotope labelled peptides.
The sequencer uses four spectra (N-terminally basis, N-terminally modified, C-terminally basis, and one C-terminally modified) to create two difference spectra: A N-terminal, and C-terminal. From the difference spectra, the de novo sequencing is performed.
The use of the difference spectrum gives rise to the name DEltaNovo.
